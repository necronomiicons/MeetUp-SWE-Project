Hello and welcome! This project, which I have dubbed 'MeetUp', is a meeting scheduling app I'm in the midst of developing. Its purpose is to aid users in keeping track of upcoming appointments. 
It's written using Flutter and Dart, and will be connected to a PostgreSQL database to store and manage user data.
